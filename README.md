<!-- Objective -->
### Objective

Covid 19 can be prevented if few norms are followed properly. Social Distancing is one of the important norms to stops spreading COVID-19. Advance Computer Vision technique can be implemented to identified if few persons are maintaining social distance or not. This can be used to spread awareness.
